<h2>About Dwell Ministries</h2>
<p>
Dwell Ministries Inc. is a Christ-centered, fully virtual ministry, where God dwells and transformation happens. We exist to reach hearts, restore families, and raise up disciples through prayer, worship, and the word. Everything online all for God’s glory.
</p>
<p>
“The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.” – Psalm 126:3 Amid the global pandemic in 2020, God began a remarkable work. What started as a simple family Zoom prayer and praise session quickly became a consistent gathering for Sunday services, family check-ins, and spiritual encouragement. As a family accustomed to regular church attendance, we sought to remain grounded in faith during uncertain times, not realizing God's greater purpose.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, as some people moved on and new ones joined, the Holy Spirit guided us. We didn’t understand the journey at the start. However, the more we prayed and were obedient, the more the call to pastoral ministry became evident. Even so, we wrestled with feelings of unworthiness, hesitant to take on such a weighty mantle. Yet, through repentant hearts, we humble ourselves before God, seeking His guidance and grace to fulfill the call. “Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.” – 1 Peter 5:6
</p>
<p>
Today, Dwell Ministries exists to be a sanctuary of hope, healing, and growth for all who come. The name “Dwell” reflects our deep desire for this ministry to be a place where people can dwell in the presence of the Lord, find rest in His promises, and grow together in faith and love. As pastors, Erin and I are committed to faithfully stewarding this calling. We walk in the footsteps of Jesus, the Good Shepherd, caring for and guiding His people as He leads us. “Feed my sheep.” – John 21:17. Through every challenge and triumph, we remain confident that God, who began this good work in us, will carry it to completion.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for being part of this journey. May we continue to dwell together in the house of the Lord forever. “Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” – Psalm 23:6
